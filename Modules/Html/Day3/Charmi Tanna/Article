NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Centre what it has learnt from the Nizamuddin Markaz congregation earlier this year 
amid Covid-19, and the same situation may arise with the protesting farmers, if precautionary measures are not taken to contain the 
spread of Covid-19.
</p>
<p>
Citing the ongoing farmers protest at various Delhi borders, a bench headed by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde asked the Solicitor General 
Tushar Mehta, "You must tell us what is happening?"
</p>
<p>
The bench also comprising Justices A.S. Bopanna and V. Ramasubramanian queried further, whether farmers protesting at various Delhi borders
are taking precaution to contain the spread of Covid-19.
</p>
<p>
When the Solicitor General replied in negative, the top court said it could potentially become a situation like the Nizamuddin Markaz congregation in the national capital, which happened in March last year. Mehta replied that he will find the status.
